### Files:
resize.py : Used to resize randomly sized images from the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shravankumar9892/image-colorization) and to convert it into any permissible type given by the opencv

chrominance.py : Is used to convert the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shravankumar9892/image-colorization) into u and v components of the CIELUV color space.

coloi.ipynb: Contains the prototype model for the TI challenge. It can easily detect object present in the image, change any image into over 150 color spaces, do small things like resizing the images, etc and also colorize black and white images

Gray scale images used for [training](https://www.kaggle.com/shravankumar9892/image-colorization) are saved as a .npy file
